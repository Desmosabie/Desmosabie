- 👋 Hi, I’m @Desmosabie
 👀 I’m interested in building a mobile app regarding politics and voter registration...
 🌱 I’m currently learning, everything, I just discovered what this is, heard of it for years just never ... 3/29/2024 and turn 46 in 11 days. 
 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI App that pulls available political calander information from National, State, County and City websites...
 📫 How to reach me, call me 707-978-1451 ...
 😄 Pronouns: ...noun, not a pro <- no that's not political from me. Playin with words and my intro. Relax. 
 ⚡ Fun fact: ... Everyone (almost), Ever, knows the name of the closest star to where we are until you ask them. Try it, when they're alone.
